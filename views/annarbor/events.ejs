    <h3>Tech Talk: "Death of the Pixel or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love All These Screen Resolutions"<h3>
    <h4>Presenter: <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcSweeny">Patrick McSweeny</a></h4>
    <p>Just a few years ago, it was entirely realistic to develop web sites for a fixed width and use pixels for just about everything but now those days seem like a distant memory. With the ever growing number of screen sizes and resolutions of devices used to access the web, it is now more important than ever to write CSS that is flexible enough to adapt to different types of screens. Toledo developer Patrick McSweeny will discuss alternatives to using pixels as the primary unit of measurement as a way to make your web sites/applications ready to deal with any screen size without the need for complicated media queries.</p>
